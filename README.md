## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 17-year-old developer, passionate about exploring and working on various
tech projects. I love diving deep into web development, constantly hacking on 
projects using TypeScript, JavaScript, Next.js, React.js, and Rust. Python 
is also one of my go-to languages for scripting and problem-solving.

I'm particularly drawn to the intricacies of programming languages and 
frameworks, always eager to experiment with and master lesser-known tools and 
systems. Whether itâ€™s building complex web applications or exploring new programming 
paradigms, Iâ€™m all in and always looking for the next challenge!
